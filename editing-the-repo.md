## How to Add to the Material the First Time.

Short version:
1. Fork the repo
2. Edit the relevant files
3. Make a pull request.

Long version:

Find the o-date/draft repo:
![odate1](/help-images/odate-1.png)

Hit the 'fork' button to make a copy:
![odate1](/help-images/odate-2.png)

The files you want to edit all end in .rmd. **do not** edit anything else. Try not to edit anything someone else is currently working on. **Note in the screenshot is says 'this branch is even with o-date:gh-pages'. IF IT SAYS 'BEHIND', [see these instructions](syncing-repo.md)**

Hit the 'edit' icon -  the pencil - to begin to write.

You can paste in text from a text editor if you prefer. I also like to toggle 'soft wrap'.

When you're ready, scroll to the bottom of the page to 'commit changes', i.e., 'save'. Leave a message indicating the nature of what you've done.

You can continue to make changes on the file(s) you're working on. Once you're satisfied, we move on to this step.
You're now ready to ask me to pull - to incorporate-  your changes into the main repository. This is a 'Pull Request'.

On this page, the only thing you need to do is hit the green button. The way to read the box above is 'pull changes INTO this repo FROM this repo'.

On this page, you leave a note describing the change(s) you've made. Then hit the green button.
![odate1](/help-images/odate-9.png)

Now you're done. It should tell you that the changes can be merged. I will get a notification. You can continue to leave comments if you want. To continue working, hit the 'code' tab. If there are any issues at this stage (say two people have edited the same line at the same time), I'll get a notification and will resolve the conflict.

### Making edits when your copy is BEHIND the official repo
- that is to say, you're copy is BEHIND by x commits
- make sure to [sync the repo](syncing-repo.md) before you write
