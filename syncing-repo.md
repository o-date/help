## How to sync the repo

Once you've forked a copy, you might find that by the time you're ready to do some work on it, the main repo might've been updated. You'll know because there'll be a gray bar across the top of the file list saying **this branch is behind**.

So what we're going to do is pull INTO your repo the update materials FROM my repo.

Begin by making a new pull request.

You'll see something like this:

Leave a little message, like, 'bringing things up to sync'. Hit the green 'create pull request' button again. You'll see something like this:

Hit the 'merge pull request' button, on the next screen hit the 'confirm merge pull request', and ta da! You're up to date with my materials. (Screenshots from this article: https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-without-the-cli/)

**NB** When you're doing a pull request, REMEMBER that the idiom is PULL **INTO** repo FROM repo.
